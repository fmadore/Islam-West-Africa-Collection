# Islam West Africa Collection
Directed by [Frédérick Madore](https://frederickmadore.com/), the *Islam West Africa Collection* is a collaborative, open-access digital database that currently contains over 5,000 archival documents, newspaper articles, Islamic publications of various kinds, audio and video recordings, and photographs on Islam and Muslims in Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Togo and Côte d'Ivoire. Most of the documents are in French, but some are also available in Hausa, Arabic, Dendi, and English. The site also indexes over 800 references to relevant books, book chapters, book reviews, journal articles, dissertations, theses, reports and blog posts. This project, hosted by the [Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient (ZMO)](https://www.zmo.de/en) and funded by the Berlin Senate Department for Science, Health and Care, is a continuation of the award-winning *Islam Burkina Faso Collection* created in 2021 in collaboration with [LibraryPress@UF](https://librarypress.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/).
